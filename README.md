# BillingPaymentsAngularPoc
The story:
- Suppose a Basic Services Payment company requires you to create a FrontEnd application for managing payments of Service Bills for their 5 clients.
- It is required that your FrontEnd accomplishes these must haves:
    - Ability to perform a bill payment based on Client ID, Type of service and Month-Year (YYYYMM) as input data and process it to change its state. Perform any required validations as you consider necessary
    - Ability to retrieve pending bills per Client
    - Ability to retrieve the history of payments

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
